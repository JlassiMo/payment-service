# Payment Service

A Spring Boot microservice for processing payments with different providers (PayPal, Stripe, Square) using the Strategy, Factory, and Observer design patterns. The service validates payment requests, checks for fraudulent transactions, and notifies various components about payment transactions.

## Features

- Process payments through multiple providers.
- Validate payment requests.
- Check for fraudulent transactions.
- Notify logging, analytics, and notification services about payment transactions.
- Use H2 in-memory database for local development.
- Externalize configuration using `application.yml`.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring WebFlux
- Spring Validation
- H2 Database
- Maven

## Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern
Used to define a family of algorithms (payment processing), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### Factory Pattern
Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is used to return the appropriate `PaymentProvider` based on the provider type.

### Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is used to notify different components (logging, analytics, notifications) about payment transactions.

## Prerequisites
### 1. JDK 11 or higher
#### 1.1 Windows

##### Step 1: Download the Java JDK
Go to the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and download the installer for Windows.

##### Step 2: Install the Java JDK
Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

##### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
2. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
3. Under "System variables", click "New" to add a new variable.
   - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
   - Variable value: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.x.x` (replace with your actual JDK installation path)
4. Find the `Path` variable, select it, and click "Edit".
5. Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory of the JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.x.x\bin`).
6. Click "OK" to close all windows.

##### Step 4: Verify the Installation
Open a new Command Prompt and run the following command to verify that Java is installed correctly:

```sh
java -version
```

You should see output similar to the following, which indicates Java is installed and ready to use:

```sh
java version "11.x.x" (where x.x is the version number)
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 11.x.x)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.x.x, mixed mode)
```

##### Additional Information
- **Update Java JDK**: To update the Java JDK in the future, download the latest version from the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and repeat the installation steps.
- **Uninstall Java JDK**: To uninstall the Java JDK, go to "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel, find the Java SE Development Kit, and uninstall it.

##### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Open Terminal.
2. Open the profile file in a text editor. You can use nano for this:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```
   If you are using zsh (default on macOS Catalina and later), edit the `.zshrc` file instead:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. Add the following lines to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
   ```sh
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```
4. Save the file and exit the text editor (Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit in nano).
5. Apply the changes by running:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```
   Or for zsh:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

#### 2.2 MacOS
To install Maven on a Mac, you can use Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

##### Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

##### Step 2: Install Maven
Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install Maven by running:

```sh
brew install maven
```

##### Step 3: Verify the Installation
After the installation is complete, verify that Maven is installed correctly by checking the version:

```sh
mvn -version
```

You should see output similar to the following, which indicates Maven is installed and ready to use:

```sh
Apache Maven 3.x.x (where x.x is the version number)
